**HOUSE PRICE PREDICTION:**
House price prediction can help the developer determine the selling price of a house and can help the customer to arrange the right time to purchase a house. There are three factors that influence the price of a house which include physical conditions, concept and location.

**IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION:**
Iris flower classification is a popular machine learning project. The goal is to classify iris flowers into three species based on their sepal and petal measurements: Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica. 
The iris dataset contains three classes of flowers, each with four features: Sepal length, Sepal width, Petal length, Petal width. 
The three species of iris can be separated using nonlinear principal component analysis.
